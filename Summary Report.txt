                Summary Report                  

In this file i am going to include the sections Steps taken,
Challenges Faced , and Contributions section.

->Steps Taken:


    1.Dataset Loading and Inital Exploration
    firstly we have  loaded the dataset and  made some initail exploaration of data 

    2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
    -In this phase we have to give a cleaned data to ml model its just
    like how we clean our clothes before we wear them
    for this in terms of our dataset reality we also need to clean the 
    dataset or data given for us so that if we give the data to model it 
    gives us predicted and accurated results so some of the methods used in
    the preprocessing are :
        ->Identifying and  Handling  missing values in dataset

        ->Test - parsing: we have Converted the  string  - formatted rent in 'monthly_rent'  columns (eg : '$$15,000/mo') into a purely numeric `monthly_rent`

        ->Feature encoding : 
            In this we have  done one  hot encoding too columns such as city, pet_policy and paymnet_schedule.

            We have Converted some of columns such as image_available , service_fee_applicable columns into boolean flags like 0/1 integers.
        
        ->Scaling and Normalization : 
            We have Standardized the continuos variables such as area_in_sqft, geo_lat, geo_lon .
            why we have Standardized these variables so that no single feature dominated model training.
    
    3. Feature Engineering : 
        -> In this section We have created and Transformed  and defined some new features to our model
        thee features  are :
            -Amenity Count: We have Transformed one of the feature that is `included_features` that  into an integer representing Count of amenities present.

            -Bedroom - Bathroom Ratio: We have created  a new feature that is `beds_to_baths_ratio=(bed_count/bath_count)`, beacuse inordere to capture the efficieny of space.

            -Rent Bucketing : We have implemented this featue tp the classifiaction based ml model it defined the bucket that is `HighRent` that indulge says whther the rennt classifies into a high or low rent.
    
    4.Exploratory Data Analysis :
        ->We have plotted histograms of 'monthly_rent', stratified by city, inorder to visualize how rents vary geographically.

        ->We have also Generated Box - plots of rent bedroom count and by amenity count to conifirm that more bedrooms/amenities generally correlated with higher rent

        ->We have Produced a correlation matrix for numeric features, that verifies that 'area_in_sqft' and 'bed_count' were among strongest linear correlates of rent.
    
    5. The  Development Phase of Model:

        -we have used two types of model for our project 

            one is Classification and other is Regression models

            because both has diiferent cases and different application but by combining both in a same notebook that in turns make some snense that
            one thing is that i may will get exposure to difficulty situations in handling classification and  Regression usage in developing model and other is 
            so we can create a clear way that it can be benefitted to such as realestate people , landlords , etc if we use them in both notebook so we make sure 
            that this notebook is capable of real world application such as Assingming each listings into a discrete category and perdict a continuos value.
    6. For the Evaluation and Interpretation of model :
        we have used classification metrics  such as classification_report etc for classifiaction models

        we have used  Regression metrics such as RMSE, R^ 2 etc for evaluating the rgression model

-> Challenges Faced:
I have faced alot problems in developing the machine learning for the given data set 
some of them are : 
    -Inconsistent Text Fields:
        We have seen that 'formatted_rent_text' columns contains a mix of currency shymbols, that indulge leads to error.
        so we have  used a robust parser  that took extra effort inorder to handle edge cases and remove waste characteres
        before Converted to an integer.
    - Missing and Inbalance in Data
        -what i have observed is About 5-7 % of listings they are lack with 
        `monthly_rent` or 'bedroom/bathroom' counts.Next i handled them after so many Steps
        and series of experiments in handling of these kind of missing data

        -The Imbalance in data i have observed in Rent Categories  by in their 60% of listings fell into the 'Mid-Tier' bucket,
        30% intp 'Entry-level' and only 10% fall into 'Premium' Bucket. In order to counter this, 
        we have used the stratified sampling during train/test splitting and weighted class into the classifier.

    - The Outlier Management:
        Some of the listings showed me extremely high or low rent relative to other features is this because duw to missing 
        amenity data or overly ambitious pricing by landlords. TO overcome this we have done experiments with trimming the 
        top and bottom 1% of rents to see if performance improved.

->The Individual Contributions :
    Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
        I have written allot of Python Scripts such as (using Pandas) inorder to clean inconsistent text formats, and some
        parse `formatted_rent_text` and imputing the missing categorical Fields

        I have also done some of the Engineering custom features , that may includes amenity counts, bedroom -bathroom ratio , 
        and one - hot encoding for multi value Fields for (e.g. : pet_policy , city)

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)    :
        We have generate some of the key plots such as histograms, box plots, correlation - heatmap etc inorder to highlight
        the relationships between rent and primary predictors.

    Model Development and  Tuning :
        In this phase i have implemented the classifiaction model : the some of steps are  : 
        splitting the data, training the multiple algorithms, conducting hyperparameter grid searches(optional), and evaluating
        the final metrics
    etc.
